    "This one is thanks to the youtuber vanAmsen for an interesting techinique making a set up tuples from a list like [a,b,c,d,e,...] to [(a,b), (b,c), (c,d),...]. We also have 3 tracker variables that track whether we have a streak of going up and when we don't we reset and with every iteration through the tuples, we compare LHS vs RHS to see if we're getting as streak."
