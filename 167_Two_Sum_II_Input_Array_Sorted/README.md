## Problem

Given a _1-indexed_ array of integers `numbers` that is **_already sorted in non-decreasing order_**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.`

Return _the indices of the two numbers_, `index1` and `index2`, **added by one** as an integer array` [index1, index2]` _of length 2._

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You **may not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

### Example 1:

    Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [1,2]
    Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

### Example 2:

    Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,3]
    Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].

### Example 3:

    Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
    Output: [1,2]
    Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

### Constraints:

    2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
    -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
    numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    -1000 <= target <= 1000
    The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
